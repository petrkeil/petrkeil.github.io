# PhDs and postodcs

I will open **several fully funded PhD and postdoc positions** between 2023-2027. The openings will be posted on this website in the [news section](https://petrkeil.github.io/news/) and on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/r_you_cereal). Do not hesitate to write us an email for more info to [beast@fzp.czu.cz](beast@fzp.czu.cz).

Also, if you have a drive for independence and a strong research idea that fits our lab, maybe you can join us by getting **your own funding** (e.g. through a [Marie Curie Action](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships), or [GACR project](https://gacr.cz/en/types-of-grant-projects/)). I can assist you with putting together the proposal. We also have funding programmes at Czech University of Life Sciences.
