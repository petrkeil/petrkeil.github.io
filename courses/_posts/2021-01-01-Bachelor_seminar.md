# Bachelor thesis seminar (ZGZ149E, winter semester)

## Summary

The aim is to give students some idea of how to write their first scientific text, i.e. their bachelor thesis. There are 6 classes (90 min each). After this is finished, in the following semester, students will present their chosen topic (5 min) at a departmental conference. 

## Syllabus

**Introduction to Bachelor thesis structure.** In essence, it’s a paper. Introduction to scientific method. Examples of finished theses. Tips and tricks for each section. Reproducibility of the methods. Data collection and databases, licensing, peer-review process – what is a peer-reviewed paper/journal. Types of papers: article, review, opinion. Hypotheses vs. objectives vs. questions. Formal requirements of CZU.

**Introduction of possible thesis topics.** Each member of the department will introduce their topics, either in person, or with a video. Students should pick a topic and get in touch with their supervisor ASAP.

**How to find and organize literature.** Web of Science, Google Scholar, Mendeley, Zotero. How to correctly cite. When to cite and which statements need a reference, general truths vs specific findings. How to cite stats. You don’t want to cite Wikipedia. Be consistent with references.
-	Software
-	Book, chapter, paper, proceedings, theses
-	Analysis
-	Mendeley
-	DOI, Trusty publishers vs. predatory journals
-	Github, Zenodo
-	SciHub
-	Research gate
-	Asking people for papers
-	Google scholar – how to find literature
-	First author/last author

**How to read papers.** How to find out if a paper is relevant for my research (abstract, skimming & screening). 20 min of exercise: Here are 2 papers, and now answer these questions: What was the authors’ goal, what did they find, some detail from the methods, some detail from the results. Reading comprehension. When NOT to read the entire paper. 

**How to write and how to present.** Outline/backbone of the text. Focus on sections that are easy to write. Track changes & collaborations with co/authors (supervisors), Google Docs vs Word? Have an open mind and embrace uncertainty/your own ignorance. 

**Rehearsal for the departmental conference.** Students will introduce their topics in a short 5 min presentation – this is a practice for the departmental conference next semester. They may still be in a very “proto” stage, but that is ok. For the conference they will have (after ca 3 months) much clearer idea.
