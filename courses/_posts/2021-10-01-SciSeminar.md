# Bi-weekly SciSeminar - science coffee

Organizers: *Petr Keil*, *Luisa Conti*


We organize an **informal bi-weekly (or irregular) seminar**, for ca 5-20 folks from our department, but external visitors are always welcome. Time and place: **Thursdays, 10:30-12:00 AM, seminar room D222** at MCEV building (FZP CZU). Duration can be anything between 0.5 and 1.5 hours.


The **content** is super flexible. We welcome classical presentations of new or old results, student theses & projects, tutorials, paper discussions, discussions of half-baked ideas, seeking solutions to problems, rehearsals for conference presentations, co-inspirations, rants, and really anything that concerns science in the broadest sense. 

Particularly welcomed and encouraged are **presentations from master and PhD students**. Importantly, if you have potential external guests, or new colleagues coming, sign them up! We (me or Luisa) can also invite them on your behalf.

If you are interested in attending, or giving a seminar, let me know at [keil@fzp.czu.cz](keil@fzp.czp)!
