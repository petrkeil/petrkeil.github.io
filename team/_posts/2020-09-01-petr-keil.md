I am a macroecologist doing research on issues of spatial scale, statistics, and biodiversity, with particular focus on temporal change of biodiversity. I work at [Faculty of Environmental Sciences](https://www.fzp.czu.cz/en/) of Czech University of Life Sciences (CZU) where I teach macroecology, biogeography, and Bayesian statistics. I am also an associate editor of [Global Ecology and Biogeography](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14668238#pane-01cbe741-499a-4611-874e-1061f1f4679e01) (Wiley) and [Nature Conservation](https://natureconservation.pensoft.net/) (Pensoft).
