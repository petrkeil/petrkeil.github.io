Carmen is an ecologist interested in investigating the mechanisms behind species’ distributions and responses to change and their variation across taxa, regions, and time, with a particular focus on mammals and birds.

Carmen’s research at the MOBI lab is within the BEAST ERC project, where she will develop and test models interpolating biodiversity change across space, time, and their scales.
