Frieda completed her master’s degree in Biodiversity, Ecology & Evolution at Leipzig University and the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig. Her research focused on the intricate interplay between macroecology and macroevolution of plants and their animal dispersers. During her academic journey, she honed her expertise in high-demand computational spatial and phylogenetic analyses, which deepened her interest in advancing her modeling and computational skills.

Frieda has joined the BEAST ERC project for her PhD to investigate universal relationships between the kinetics of biodiversity change and its reflection in static biodiversity data across various groups of organisms at macro scales.
