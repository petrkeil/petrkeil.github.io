Dani is interested in biogeography, macroecology, and the use of phylogenetic comparative methods. She is currently doing her Ph.D. at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. She is working on disentangling how the spore type has evolved in ferns and how it influences their distribution and habit preferences. She has studied epiphytic assemblies and collaborated in research about bird's diversity in Southern Chile.

In MOBI lab Dani works on management and extraction of spatio-temporal biodiversity data, their processing, and also analysis.
