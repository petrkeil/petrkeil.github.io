Flo is an Uruguayan biologist, doing research in macroecology and biodiversity informatics focused on the study of spatial and temporal patterns of biodiversity. She's also the founder of Biodiversidata, a member of the JULANA NGO, the admin for the NaturalistaUY site, and a NatGeoExplorer.

Flo's research at MOBI lab focuses on large-scale temporal dynamics of geographic distributions of mammals in Latin America. For this she uses cutting-edge Bayesian models and large data compilations that she's put together thanks to her massive network of collaborators across Latin America.
