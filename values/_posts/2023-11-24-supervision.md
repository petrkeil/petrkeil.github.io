# Expectations, responsibilities, power dynamics, and supervision in MOBI lab

Author: *Petr Keil*

## For all members

**Names, titles, polite opening phrases in emails**. I prefer to be called Petr, and expect me to switch to calling you using your first name quickly. If you are unsure how to addres me in an email, then "Dear Petr" or "Hi Petr" are ideal. If you insist on being formal, then "Dear Dr. Keil" ok. However, I am aware that there is a minefield of cultural differences, and I've decided not to take this game too seriously.

**20% independent time rule**. All members of mobi lab are entitled to dedicate 20% of their paid time to projects of their own, with no obligation to involve the PI or other lab member. This is meant to encourage development of their own ideas, testing stuff and experimentation, creative procrastination, work on job applications, or finishing work carried over from previous jobs. 

**Finishing things from your previous job**. It's normal that postdocs (and sometimes PhD students) need to finish papers from their previous jobs. I respect that, if it doesn't seriously jeopardize your work in MOBI lab. I expect that these obligations are finished pragmatically and effectively, with the focus on getting the thing out of the table. You should take the full charge of the issue, even if it means overriding the opinion of your former advisor. If they are not formally your advisor any more, then you are the main person in charge of the paper, and you decide how and where to publish it and how to proceed with the review process. If your former advisor is unresponsive or not supportive in getting the paper sorted asap, or if their influence over the process interferes with your work in MOBI lab, then I am ready to interfere. 

**Help with job and grant applications**. I am ready to support MOBI lab members in their effort to find jobs elsewhere, or to secure their own funding. I offer going through/commenting on your applications and proposals, writing letters of recommendation etc.  

**Work-related crises**. Work-related concerns, frustrations, lack of progress or motivation, dead ends, dealine anxieties, impostor syndromes, philosophical crises, etc are expected to occur in life of every academic. I am no stranger to these. If it helps, I am here to listen and to hopefully help addressing these. The sooner you communicate these, the easier it might be to find solutions.

**Psychological help**. For students we have a student counsellor [Klara Ten Dondelaar](https://www.fzp.czu.cz/cs/r-6896-studenti/r-12299-poradenstvi-pro-studenty). Klara is a university-appointed psychologist who offers free interventions and consultations. You can either ([email Klara](tendonkelaar@fzp.czu.cz)) or she has a 15 min slots every Monday in room D328 (MCEVII) where you can just come without an appointment. Klara has also created a curated and updated [list of contacts for psychological help](https://www.fzp.czu.cz/dl/76836?lang=cs).

## PhD students

A normal PhD program takes 4 years or more. 

**Year 1**. In the first year I expect the student to be adjusting to the new environment, the topic, and the team and our routines. This also means that the thesis topic, as initially stated, is still open for adjustments and changes. In the end of the first year the student should have a good idea about the first main analysis that will be done. I strongly recommend to start working on an **anchor paper** during the first year of PhD. It can be a review of the topic, a short perspective paper, or a simple analysis, and the aim is to simply push it through the review process irrespectively to the impact of the journal. This should give the student the taste of the entire process, as well as a good feeling from something being finished, and to tick the first requirement of the PhD study (i.e. to publish a first-author ISI-listed paper). I remember that, when I saw my first paper published, I was so happy about it, even though it was published just in a local German entomological journal, and it was a big boost in my motivation to continue doing science.

**Years 2-4**. I expect the student to get more proactive and independent with every chapter of the PhD thesis.
