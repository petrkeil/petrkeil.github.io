We are excited to announced that, since 23rd of January, we have a new member of MOBI lab, Dr. Carmen Soria! Carmen did her PhD on **Projected effect of global change on species' change in extinction risk** ([open access repository](https://iris.uniroma1.it/handle/11573/1652541)) with Carlo Rondinini and Michela Pacifici at Sapienza Universita di Roma, Italy, within the  [Global Mammal Assessment](https://globalmammal.org/). She also closely collaborated with Stuart Butchard from [BirdLife International](https://www.birdlife.org/). 

Carmen is an ecologist interested in investigating the mechanisms behind species’ distributions and responses to change and their variation across taxa, regions, and time, with a particular focus on mammals and birds. She has experience with compiling large databases of functional traits (e.g. [here](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecy.3344#support-information-section)).

Carmen’s research at the MOBI lab will be within the BEAST ERC project, where she will develop and test models interpolating biodiversity change across space, time, and their scales.
