A significant part of MOBI lab (Carmen, Francois, Flo, Petr) attended the [2023 annual meeting of Ecological Society of America in Portland, Oregon](https://esa.org/portland2023/). More than 4,000 visitors, massive poster session, workshops (thanks NASA!), and I must admit that we all nailed our talks! I was initially worried that it will be thematically too broad, but in the end I loved almost all of it, it was an intense and motivating experience. 

These were our talk titles:

- **Grattarola F**, Bowler D, Keil P: Assessing hotspots of geographic range changes for charismatic carnivores in the Neotropics using Integrated Species Distribution Models (ISDM)

- **Soria C**, Pacifici M, Butchard S, Rondinini C: Latitude, environmental conditions, and traits influence mammal and bird responses to climate change

- **Leroy F**, Jarzyna M, Keil P: Decomposing temporal changes of biodiversity to loss, survival, and recruitment of individuals - a cross-scale analysis of Northern-American breeding birds

- **Keil P**, Clark A, Bartak V, Leroy F: Connecting spatial scaling of biodiversity change to ecological processes: Allee effect, Janzen-Connell effect, target effect, and beyond
