title: Tentative PhD position opportunities for 2023 - biodiversity, remote sensing
author: Petr Keil
---

Are you a master student in your final year? Are you pondering a carreer in academia, biodiversity research, or remote sensing?

I will open 2 fully funded PhD positions in 2023. Official announcement will be out in January 2023, the admission process will happen in March 2024, and the PhD program will start Sep-Oct 2023.
The funding for each position will be for 4 whole years, and I expect the students to participate full time and in-person. The income will consist of regular student stipend + a good salary.

So far this is a preliminary announcement, and I do not collect official applications yet. However, send us an email if you feel like you'd be a good match to our research and team, and we will try to get back to you in January. 

Please use the [beast@fzp.czu.cz](beast@fzp.czu.cz) email for this, and **put "PhD 2023" in the subject**.
