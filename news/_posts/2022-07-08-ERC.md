Petr has been awarded [ERC consolidator grant](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/consolidator-grants) by the European Research Council. The aim of the project is to explore what's been happening with terrestrial biodiversity, testing new models connecting local and regional processes. 

The grant agreement hasn't been signed yet, but preparations have been in progress to locate the grant at Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague. 

Stay tuned for PhD/postdoc openings!
