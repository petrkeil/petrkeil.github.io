We've been awarded a 3-year [project GRACE](https://www.adamclarktheecologist.com/grace) (**“GRAssland Communities Experiment (GRACE): 300 years of insight from a large-scale natural experiment**”, 2024-2026). GRACE is a joint grant from the Austrian FWF and Czech GACR, with co-PIs [Adam Clark](https://www.adamclarktheecologist.com/) (University of Graz) and Petr Keil (CZU, Prague), and cooperation partners [Franz Essl](https://ucris.univie.ac.at/portal/en/persons/franz-essl(fd5c9c26-1334-441c-926a-20df5e6d2f9b).html) at Uni. Vienna and [Hana Skokanová](https://www.ekologie-krajiny.cz/index.php/en/skokanova-hana) at VUKOZ, Brno. Other external collaborators include Helge Bruelheide and Ute Jandt at Uni. Halle (Germany), Stefan Dullinger at Uni. Vienna, and Milan Chytrý at Masaryk University Brno, as well as the European Vegetation Archive (EVA) and its ReSurveyEurope initiatives.

The research focuses on tracking interactive dynamics of landscapes and grassland plant communities, based on the natural experiment arising from differences in landscape structure along the Austrian-Czech border region.

CZU and MOBI lab will host **one full-time postdoc position** funded from GRACE. We will also be looking for a **field botanist** for the 2024  and 2025 vegetation season. Get in touch if you know your plants and you're looking for a seasonal summer job!
