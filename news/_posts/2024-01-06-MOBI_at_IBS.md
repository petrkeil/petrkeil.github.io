We have attended the [11th Biennial Conference of the International Biogeography Society](https://www.biogeography.org/prague2024/) (7-11th January 2024, Prague, Czech Republic). Huge thanks to the organizers, particularly to Anna Toszogyova and David Storch from CTS!

These were our posters:

- **Leroy F**, Jarzyna M, Keil P: Acceleration and demographic rates of bird decline in North America

- **Soria C**, Ortega-Solis G, Bartak V, Stastny K, Bejcek V, Mikulas I, Keil P: Spatial autocorrelation of diversity and distributions in time and across spatial grains

- **Bazzichetto M**, de Belo F, Perrone M, Gotzenberger L, Keil P: Biodiversity-related mechanisms of ecosystem resistance under compoud dry-hot extreme events

- **Ortega-Solis G**, Mellado-Mansilla D, Craven D, Kreft H, Diaz I, Tello F, Tejo C, Armnesto J: Distribution and effects of trash-basket epiphytes and tank-bromelias on canopy biodiversity and ecosystem functions

- **Mellado-Mansila D**, Weigelt P, Kessler M, Craven D, Zotz G, Kreft H: The global distribution of ferns with chlorophyllous spores

- Tschernosterova K, Travnickova E, Grattarola F, **Keil P**: SPARSE 1.0: a tamplate for databases of species inventories, with an open example of Czech Birds

- Grattarola F, Tschernosterova K, **Keil P**: Evidence of neotropical carnivores' continental geographic range contractions over the last two decades

And some of us gave talks:

- **Wolke F**, Cabral A, Lim J, Kissling WD, Onstein R: Africa as an evolutionary arena for large fruits

- **Keil P**, Clark A, Bartak V, Leroy F: Connecting spatial scaling of biodiversity change to per-individual ecological processes
