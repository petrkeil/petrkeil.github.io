title:  Two trait-based papers out - bird population trends in Czechia, and plant diversity gradients in Tenerife

Petr is a co-author on two new studies, both examining ecological patterns using **species traits**: 

1. [Storch et al. (2023, *Diversity and Distributions*)](../../../../pdfs/papers/Storch_2023_DiDi.pdf)) examines how have populations of Czech birds changed in time. We revealed that population trajectories can be classified to several types: linear trends, hump-shaped vs U-shaped trents, and more complex trends. These trends then correspond to specific species properties (traits). For example, species with increasing populations have long lifespand, warm climatic niches, and live in forests, while we observe population declines mosly in farmland birds.

2. [Backes et al. (2023, *Journal of Vegetation Science*)](../../../../pdfs/papers/Backes_2023_JVS.pdf) asks why plant biodiversity in Tenerife declines towards high altitude. By looking jointly at biodiversity and functional traits, we show that the main driver of this decline is the joint effect of temperature and human disturbance, and not precipitation or decline in area towards high altitude. The lead author is [Amanda R. Backes](https://www.botanik.uni-halle.de/geobotanik/amanda_ratier_backes/) from from botanical garden in Halle (MLU Halle-Wittenberg, Germany).
