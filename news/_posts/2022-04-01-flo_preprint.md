Flo has submitted her manuscript on *Integrating presence-only and presence-absence data to model changes in species geographic ranges: An example of yaguarund√≠ in Latin America*( see the [preprint on EcoEvoRxiv](https://ecoevorxiv.org/67c4u/)). This was a fantastic collaboration between us and Diana Bowler. Let's see how the manuscript fares in review now.
