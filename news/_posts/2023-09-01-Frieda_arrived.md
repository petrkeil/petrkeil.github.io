Frieda has joined our lab for her PhD to investigate universal relationships between biodiversity change and its reflection in static biodiversity data across various groups of organisms at macro scales.

Frieda did her master studies at iDiv (Leipzig, Germany) with Renske Onstein, which resulted in a [paper in New Phytologist](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.19061)! More on [Frieda's website](https://friedarosa.github.io/).
