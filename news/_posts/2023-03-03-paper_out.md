author: Petr Keil

Petr, Flo, and Francois are co-authors on a new review paper ([Moudry et al. 2023, *Progress in Physical Geography*](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03091333231156362)) that provides guidelines on how to do species distribution modelling (SDM) when predictors and responses have different spatial grains (resolutions). The lead author is our colleague from Department of Spatial Sciences [Vitezslav Moudry](http://www.gisdata.cz/).
