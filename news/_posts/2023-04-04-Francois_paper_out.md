title:  Francois' first PhD chapter published - A review on how has bird diversity changed in time
author: Petr Keil
---

Huge congratulations to Francois, who has just managed to push his first PhD chapter through peer review ([Leroy et al. 2023, *Basic and Applied Ecology*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179123000117?via%3Dihub))!

The paper is a review of current empirical literature on biodiversity change in birds, with focus on comprehensive studies of multiple sites across larger geographic areas. The study found that the magnitude and direction of biodiversity change depends on scale, but also on metric considered. Plus there is a considerable mess in how temporal scale is treated across the literature, and there are massive geographic biases. 

See [Francois' webpage](https://frslry.github.io/) for more info on his research.
