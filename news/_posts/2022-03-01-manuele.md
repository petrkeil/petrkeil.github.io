In October 2022, [Manuele Bazzichetto](hhttps://scholar.google.it/citations?user=RysWTycAAAAJ&hl=it) will start his 2-year Marie Curie postdoc fellowship with us at MOBI lab and Department of Spatial Sciences. He will study the effect of climatic extremes on ecosystem stability in plant communities - another facet in the complex picture of global biodiversity change. We are thrilled to have you Manuele!
