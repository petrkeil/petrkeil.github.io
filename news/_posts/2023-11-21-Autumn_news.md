Too many things happened this fall, and I didn't have time to report them. So here is the "best of":

**Dani has joined MobiLab**. In Oct 2023, [Deniela Mellado-Mansilla](https://petrkeil.github.io/team/2023/11/01/daniela_mellado.html) joined MOBI lab as a part-time data technician. Welcome Dani!

**MOBI lab has registered for IBS annual meeting**. You will have the opportunity to meet us at the [International Society of Biogeography 11th Biennial Conference](https://www.biogeography.org/prague2024/) on 7-11 January 2024. Petr, Carmen, Manuele, Francois, Frieda, and Gabriel will be there with their posters and talks! 

**Petr gave an [interview for ekolist.cz](https://ekolist.cz/cz/publicistika/rozhovory/hledam-odpoved-na-otazku-co-se-deje-s-biodiverzitou-rika-makroekolog-petr-keil-ktery-ziskal-prestizni-grant-erc)** (in Czech). This is an interview about our research, the new ERC project BEAST, and some additional thoughts. Many thanks to Martin Mach for the patience with me! 

**MOBI lab, BEAST, and GRACE have [new logos](https://github.com/petrkeil/logos)**. This is thanks to graphic designer [Adam Vosmera](https://www.tridvajedna.cz/nas-tym/adam-vosmera).

**Flo Grattarola has been awarded CZU rector prize** for her co-authorship on a paper on ["The benefits of contributing to the citizen science platform iNaturalist as an identifier"](https://flograttarola.com/publication/plosbiology2022/PLOSBiology2022.pdf). Congrats Flo!
