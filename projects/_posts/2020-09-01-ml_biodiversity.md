# Using machine learning to detect biodiversity change 

*Petr Keil, Francois Leroy*

We love machine learning. Togehter with Francois, we are constantly exploring ways to use it to model temporal biodiversity change.

Check out [Francois'GitHub page](https://github.com/FrsLry?tab=repositories), and [Petr's new preprint](https://ecoevorxiv.org/rky7b/).
