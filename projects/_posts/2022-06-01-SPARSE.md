# SPARSE - SPecies AcRoss ScalEs

*Petr Keil, Eva Travnickova, Katerina Tschernosterova, Florencia Grattarola*

There are too many different biodiversity datasets: checklists, redlists, local inventories, camera trap surveys, point observations, gridded atalses, etc. Working jointly with all these data can be daunting.

To address this, we have started to work on database structure that we can use to store as many different types of biodiversity data as possible, together with metadata and sampling protocols.

The database stores everything locally, it is open, flexible, simple (it only has a couple of tables), and interoperable with other databases since it uses Darwin Core and Humboldt Core standards.  

Check it out [here on GitHub](https://github.com/petrkeil/SPARSE).
