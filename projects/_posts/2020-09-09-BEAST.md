# BEAST: Biodiversity dynamics across a continuum of space, time, and their scales

*Petr Keil et al*

This ERC-funded project (2023-2027) will estimate how has biodiversity changed across continents and over the last decades. There are concerns that humanity has triggered the [sixth mass extinction](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09678). However, [some studies](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1620) show that change at the local level is much more nuanced. In other words, species are disappearing from the planet, but it seems that not much has been happening on an average patch behind your house. Furthermore, we know very little about how these small and large-scale processes are connected, and where exactly on Earth are they happening. At the same time, estimates of biodiversity change are needed and explicitly required (see e.g. [Aichi targets](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/)) for informed decisions and conservation policy. Despite this, we still lack reliable estimates of how fast, where, and in which environments biodiversity changes.

BEAST will investigate these changes and the contrast between the local, regional, and global scale, and will connect them using a unified model. We think that the local changes in biodiversity that happen in our immediate surroundings are different from the changes that take place at the level of regions, states, and continents. This can be tested using large databases such as the [Unified Bird Census Program of the Czech Ornithological Society](https://www.birdlife.cz/co-delame/vyzkum-a-ochrana-ptaku/vyzkum-ptaku/jpsp/), the [American Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eesc/science/north-american-breeding-bird-survey), [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), and similar datasets based on citizen science.
