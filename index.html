        <b>Modelling of Biodiversity Laboratory</b> (MOBI Lab) is a new research group at Department of Spatial Sciences at <a href="https://www.fzp.czu.cz/en">FZP CZU</a> in Prague, Czech Republic. We are currently funded by the <a href="https://www.fzp.czu.cz/en/r-9676-news/announcement-of-rees.html">REES program</a>.

      We study:

      <ul>
       <li><b>Geographic distribution of biological diversity.</b> Why are some places on Earth  full of living things, while other places arenâ€™t? Why are there fever than 100 species of trees that live in the millions of km<sup>2</sup> of boreal forests in Eurasia and North america, while there can be hundreds of species cooccurring in as little as 50 ha in a tropical forest of South America or Asia?</li>
       <div class="spacer"></div>
       <li><b>Temporal biodiversity change, loss, and gain.</b> We likely face a loss of biological diversity caused by humans. Intensive agriculture, deforestation, overexploitation, climate change, or biological invasions all change nature. We study where, why, and how fast this change happens. </li>
       <div class="spacer"></div>
       <li><b>Statistics, machine learning, spatial and temporal scale.</b> We develop new models for big and messy data of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We are interested in scientific methodology, particularly in statistics, machine learning, and all sorts of artifacts related to physical constraints, geometry, and scales of the world. </li>
       </ul>
